# html-source-viewer

HTML Source Viewer: The app allows users to input HTML source code. It displays the source code in a structured manner, similar to how it would appear in a text editor.

Interactive Template Creation: Users can interact with the HTML source code in a visual interface, similar to Chrome DevTools. This includes viewing both the rendered web-page and the page's source simultaneously.

Element Selection: Users can select various elements within the HTML source code. This selection allows them to identify elements they want to convert into Jinja template variables.

Variable Assignment: After selecting elements, users can assign them to template variables. This process involves defining placeholders within the Jinja template for the selected elements.
